# üéÆ Level Progression Guide - Retro Platform Fighter

## üéØ How Level Progression Works

The game has **5 unique levels** with increasing difficulty. Here's how progression works:

### üìã Level Completion Requirements

2. **Defeat the level boss** (appears after all robots are defeated)
3. **Level complete message** will appear
4. **Click "Continue"** to advance to the next level

### üèóÔ∏è Level Structure

| Level | Robots | Platform Layout | Difficulty |
|-------|--------|----------------|------------|
| 1     | 6      | Simple platforms | Easy |
| 2     | 9      | More platforms | Medium |
| 3     | 11     | Vertical challenge | Medium-Hard |
| 4     | 12     | Complex layout | Hard |
| 5     | 16     | Ultimate challenge | Very Hard |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Level Progression Functions
- `checkLevelCompletion()` - Checks if level is complete
- `levelComplete()` - Handles level completion
- `nextLevel()` - Advances to next level
- `initLevel(levelNum)` - Initializes specific level
- `updateUI()` - Updates level display

### Debug Functions (Console Commands)
```javascript
// Test level progression
testLevelProgression()

// Skip to specific level (1-5)
skipToLevel(3)

// Test API endpoints
testAPI()
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Level Display Shows Only "1":
1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Try refreshing** the page
3. **Use debug function**: `skipToLevel(2)` to test
4. **Check network tab** for API errors

### If Level Won't Progress:
1. **Make sure all robots are defeated** (check robot counter)
2. **Defeat the boss** (appears at right side of level)
3. **Look for level complete message**
4. **Use debug function**: `testLevelProgression()` to force completion

### Common Issues:
- **Robots hiding**: Some robots may be on platforms or far right
- **Boss not appearing**: Must defeat ALL robots first
- **UI not updating**: Refresh page or use `updateUI()` in console

## üéØ Gameplay Tips

### Level Progression Strategy:
1. **Explore the entire level** - robots can be anywhere
2. **Use super diamonds wisely** - save for difficult sections
3. **Jump attacks are powerful** - 30 damage to robots
4. **Boss fights require strategy** - use power-ups
5. **Collect diamonds for health** - you'll need them in later levels

### Power-up Strategy by Level:
- **Level 1-2**: Learn mechanics, collect diamonds
- **Level 3**: Use super jump for vertical sections
- **Level 4**: Super strength for tough robots
- **Level 5**: Invincibility for survival
